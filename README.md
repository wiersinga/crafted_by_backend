## Installation
After you have installed PHP and Composer, you may create a new Laravel project via Composer's `create-project` command:

```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel example-app
```
Or, you may create new Laravel projects by globally installing the Laravel installer via Composer:
```bash
composer global require laravel/installer
 
laravel new example-app
```
Once the project has been created, start Laravel's local development server using Laravel Artisan's serve command:
```bash
cd example-app
 
php artisan serve
```
Once you have started the Artisan development server, your application will be accessible in your web browser at http://localhost:8000. Next, you're ready to start taking your next steps into the Laravel ecosystem. Of course, you may also want to configure a database.
